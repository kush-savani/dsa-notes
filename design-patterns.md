## Creational patterns  

### Singleton
   - Has only one instance globally
   - The Singleton pattern disables all other means of creating objects of a class except for the special creation method. This method either creates a new object or returns an existing one if it has already been created.
Ex: 1. Single database object shared by different parts of the program.
